![FreqUI CI](https://github.com/freqtrade/frequi/workflows/FreqUI%20CI/badge.svg)

Freqtrade UI build with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [boostrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/).

## WARNING

This project is still in its early stages (consider it alpha), and is not yet stable nor recommended to be used for production usages.

## Run this project

Using FreqUI, does require [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) to be setup and running.
In newer versions (2021.2 and newer), freqUI is builtin to freqtrade, so manual setup of freqUI will no longer be necessary unless you want to modify freqUI.
Instructions for this end-user setup can be found in the [freqtrade API documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/rest-api/).

## Developer project setup

It will require [freqtrade](https://github.com/freqtrade/freqtrade) to be running on the same host with the API enabled under (`localhost:8080`). You can either use the webpack proxy (port can be changed in `vue.config.js`) - or connect directly to the API (recommended).

You will also have to have CORS for freqtrade configured correctly based on the [freqtrade documentation](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/latest/rest-api/#cors).
Most likely, the correct entry will be `http://localhost:3000` or `http://127.0.0.1:3000` - but the URL must match the URL you use to access FreqUI.
Ports can vary, so check the URL you're using.
